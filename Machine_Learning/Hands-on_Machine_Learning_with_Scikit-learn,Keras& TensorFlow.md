**记录这本书的学习过程**
# 1. The Machine Learning Landscape 机器学习概览
# 2. End-to-End Machine Learning Project 从头至尾的机器学习项目
*该项目用到的所有的API*
## 2.1. Working with Real Data
>it is best to experiment with real world data, not artificail datasets.
最好用真实世界的数据集，而不是人工数据集。
## 2.2. Look at the Big Picture
### 2.2.1. Frame the Problem
>Building a model is probably not the end goal.
建立一个模型不是最终的目标。

>Knowing the objective is important because it will determine how you frame the **problem**, which **algorithms** you will select, which **performance measure** you will use to evaluate your model, and how much **effort** you will spend tweaking it.

## 2.3. Get the Data
## 2.4. Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights
## 2.5. Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms
## 2.6. Select and Train a Model
## 2.7. Fine-Tune Your Model
